/**
 * Where you are, on the line the title bar uses while the overlay is clickable.
 *
 * It was a card among the others, which was the wrong shape twice over: a room
 * name is prose where every other card is five characters, and the two things
 * are never wanted at the same moment. While you are playing, the chrome above
 * the readout is invisible and its row is empty — so the room goes there, and
 * gives the cards their width back. Press the hotkey and the title, the badges
 * and the buttons take the row again, which is the moment you stopped looking
 * at which room you are in and started configuring the thing.
 *
 * The run count rides along at the right. It is a number, but a slow one — it
 * moves a handful of times an hour where the cards below move every second —
 * so a whole card of the readout was width spent on something that is really
 * context for the room beside it: this is your fifth of these.
