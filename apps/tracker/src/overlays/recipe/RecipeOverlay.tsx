 * what makes white text on a snowfield legible. Pressing the hotkey adds a
 * grip and some buttons; it does not add a background.

 * the icon — you already know what a Gnarled Branch looks like — with the name
 * written into the bottom of it for the ones you do not, and the count on its
 * own line underneath, where nothing can be drawn over the only number that
 * moves.

 * takes, whether or not those are themselves craftable. The hammer on a
 * craftable material opens it up into a line of its own — "I am making that
 * one too" — and the × on such a line closes it again. Expanding everything by
 * default would bury the one line you actually asked for under the recipe for
 * every ingot in it.
