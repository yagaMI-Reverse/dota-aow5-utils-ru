/**
 * Updating the tracker from its own GitHub releases.
 *
 * The release side has existed since packaging did: `publish: github` in
 * `electron-builder.yml` makes electron-builder write a `latest.yml` beside the
 * installer on every tagged release, and that file is the whole protocol. This
 * module is the other half — the part that reads it and asks.
 *
 * Nothing here happens on its own. No check on launch, no download in the
 * background, no restart nobody pressed: the app is an always-on-top overlay
 * drawn over a live game, and every one of those would be an interruption at
 * the worst possible moment. Three buttons in the settings window drive the
 * whole thing, in order.
 *
 * The one exception is `autoInstallOnAppQuit`, left on. A downloaded update
 * applying when somebody quits from the tray costs them nothing — the session
 * is over by then — and it means an update fetched and then left alone does not
 * have to be fetched again next time.
